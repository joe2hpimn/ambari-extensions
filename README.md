zData Ambari Extensions
=======================
Ambari is a tool which makes provisioning, managing, and monitoring of Apache Hadoop deployments easy.  zData's Ambari Extensions builds atop Ambari to provide easy deployment and management of HAWQ, Chorus, and soon other Pivotal technologies.

[Visit the project's documentation for quick start guides and more information.](http://zdata-inc.github.io/ambari-extensions)

Most work is now done on either the [vanilla](https://github.com/zdata-inc/ambari-extensions/tree/vanilla) and [pivotal](https://github.com/zdata-inc/ambari-extensions/tree/pivotal) branches.  This branch will not be updated further.
