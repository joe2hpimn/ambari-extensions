Greenplum & Ambari on AWS in under 30 Minutes
=============================================

Virtualization is awesome.  It is without a doubt one of the technologies that will really shape how we use computers in the coming decades.  Virtualization is also being heavily developed.  zData has long awaited the day when the technology would mature to a point where Greenplum could be deployed to completely virtual infrastructure.

Well the wait is over!

We here at zData have put together a short demonstration of deploying Greenplum through Ambari in the AWS cloud.  We cover the basics of getting a working Greenplum cluster setup and working, as well as cover some potential pitfalls and performance concerns.

Please note **this is not a production environment**.  We will make a few tweaks for performance, but getting all the performance possible from AWS is out of the scope of a video, blog post, or for that matter a single book.  If you're interested in deploying a production Greenplum environment in AWS drop us a line at sales@zdatainc.com.

Without further delay, checkout the demonstration below to get an idea of the process, and stick around to read and go through the process at your own pace.
